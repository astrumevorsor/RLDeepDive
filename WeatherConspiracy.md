**Problem: The Great Weather Conspiracy**

Imagine you're a conspiracy theorist living in a small town where the weather seems to follow a peculiar pattern. You've been tracking the weather religiously, and you suspect that the local weather station is run by a secret society that manipulates the weather according to a Markov chain model. Hereâ€™s how it unfolds:

**Your Task:**

1. **Sunny Days (State 0)**: Every sunny day, there's a 70% chance the next day will be sunny, a 20% chance it will be cloudy, and a 10% chance it will rain. But here's the twist: Every time it's sunny, your neighbor's cat, Whiskers, starts to glow slightly. You believe this glow is due to secret weather control experiments.

2. **Cloudy Days (State 1)**: On cloudy days, the probability of the next day being sunny drops to 30%, with equal chances of remaining cloudy or turning into rain. During these days, you notice that the local birds sing out of tune, which you interpret as them being in on the conspiracy or just very confused.

3. **Rainy Days (State 2)**: With a 50% chance of staying rainy, it feels like the weather station is just lazy. However, if it does change, it's more likely to go cloudy (30%) than sunny (20%). You've noticed that on rainy days, your umbrella always seems to break, which you attribute to the conspiracy's attempt to keep you indoors.

**The Challenge:**

- You've been asked to give a presentation to the town's "Society of Weather Anomalies and Conspiracies" (SWAC) about this pattern. 
- Use the Markov chain you've simulated to predict the next 100 days of weather, showing how this alleged manipulation occurs. 
- Explain why this pattern suggests a conspiracy, focusing on the peculiar behaviors (like the glowing cat and tuning-challenged birds) as evidence.

**Bonus:**
- If your simulation shows an unexpected run of sunny days, argue how this could be the secret society's attempt to lull the town into a false sense of security before unleashing a week-long rain fest.

**Note:** Remember to present your findings with enough humor and skepticism to keep the SWAC members intrigued but not alarmed. After all, no one wants to start a panic over a potentially weather-controlling cat.
